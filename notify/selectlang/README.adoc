= Selection Language for Notify

== Overview

The selection language uses a SQL-like syntax for specifying selection criteria. The basic format is:

```
SELECT * FROM Notification WHERE <conditions>
```

The selection language enables filtering notification events based on both object properties and log entries:

* *Object properties* (`obj.*`) - Filter based on shadow device/object metadata
* *Log properties* (`log.*`) - Filter based on log entry details including operations and paths

=== Object and Log Properties

.Available Properties for Filtering
[cols="2,2,4,4"]
|===
| Category | Property | Description | Example Usage

| Object | `obj.ID` 
| The unique identifier of the shadow device/object 
| `obj.ID == 'device-123'`

| Object | `obj.Name` 
| The name of the shadow device/object 
| `obj.Name == 'homeShadow'`

| Object | `obj.Operation` 
| The operation type performed on the shadow (report, desired, delete) 
| `obj.Operation IN 'report', 'desired'`

| Log | `log.Operation` 
| The operation performed in the log entry (add, update, remove, acknowledge, no-change) 
| `log.Operation IN 'add', 'update'`

| Log | `log.Path` 
| The path to the property changed in the log entry 
| `log.Path ~= 'sensors/.*/indoor'`

| Log | `log.Name` 
| Alias for log.Path, kept for backward compatibility 
| `log.Name == 'sensors/temperature/indoor'`

| Log | `log.Value` 
| The value associated with a log entry. Can be a scalar or a map 
| `log.Value > 20` or `log.Value HAS 'temp'`

=== Supported Operators

* *Comparison operators:* `==` (equals), `!=` (not equals), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal), `<=` (less than or equal)
* *Pattern matching:* `~=` (regex match) and `~!=` (regex not match)
* *Collection operators:* `IN` (value in list), `HAS` (map key exists)
* *Time operators:* `before`, `after` (for timestamp comparisons)
* *Logical operators:* `AND`, `OR`, and parentheses for grouping

=== Examples

==== Object Property Examples

.Filter by Device ID
```sql
SELECT * FROM Notification WHERE obj.ID == 'device-123'
```

.Filter by Device ID with Regex
```sql
SELECT * FROM Notification WHERE obj.ID ~= 'myDevice-\\d+'
```

.Filter by Object Name and Operation
```sql
SELECT * FROM Notification WHERE obj.Name == 'homeShadow' AND obj.Operation IN 'report', 'desired'
```

==== Log Property Examples

.Filter by Log Operation
```sql
SELECT * FROM Notification WHERE log.Operation IN 'add', 'update'
```

.Filter by Path with Regex
```sql
SELECT * FROM Notification WHERE log.Path ~= 'sensors/.*/indoor'
```

.Filter by Value (Scalar)
```sql
SELECT * FROM Notification WHERE log.Path == 'sensors/temperature/indoor' AND log.Value > 20
```

.Filter by Value (Map)
```sql
SELECT * FROM Notification WHERE log.Path == 'sensors/temperature/indoor' AND log.Value HAS 'temp'
```

==== Combined Examples

.Complex Combined Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM Notification WHERE
  (obj.ID ~= 'myDevice-\\d+' AND obj.Name == 'homeShadow')
  AND
  (
    (log.Operation IN 'add', 'update' AND log.Path ~= 'sensors/.*/indoor' AND log.Value > 20)
    OR
    (log.Operation == 'acknowledge')
  )
```

=== Implementation Details

The selection language is implemented using ANTLR4 for parsing expressions. When evaluating a selection, the system:

1. Parses the SQL-like expression into a selection tree
2. Evaluates the selection against a `NotifierOperation` object
3. Returns whether the operation matches the selection criteria

=== Constraints & Limitations

This is a pre-alpha _DSL_ - expect problems and limitations!
