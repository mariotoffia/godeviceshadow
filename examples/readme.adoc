== Merge Package
This shows how to use and expect from the merge package.

.Merging
[source,go]
----
include::./merge_test.go[]
----
<1> This is the baseline (e.g. gotten from _DynamoDB_)
<2> Acts as the update to the device shadow.
<3> Simple logger that logs each merge event in a single row (good for debugging)
<4> No deletion is possible only: add, update and no change are permitted (use `ClientIsMaster` to allow deletions)
<5> It is possible to have multiple merge loggers attached e.g. one to log, one to update _Amazon Aurora DSQL_ table and so on.
<6> In this case we are in suync with latest, but where there any deletes in _res_, those would not been propagated.
